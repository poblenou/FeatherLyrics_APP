# Feather Lyrics - Experimental Fork

This repository contains the source code for the Feather Lyrics (Android APP).

## How does it work?

The APP's puts working on background a BroadcastReceiver that gets listens at the song and artist name from the the current playing track on Android media.
When the user interface is opened, the APP takes the data collected by the BroadcastReceiver. When requested it, lyrics from the actual song are downloaded.

· API Rest Services:

The following API's have been already implemented in the same software layer, are set to communicate beetwen them and are working together to achieve great results.

- Vagalume API -> http://api.vagalume.com.br/docs/
- Spotify API -> https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/
- Last.Fm -> http://www.last.fm/es/api

The lyrics, and album arts are taken from Vagalume's API, artist pictures are taken from Spotfy's API and the artist's bio is requested to LastFm API.

· Plus one aditional storage service to handle the users system:
